# Getting Started with Create React App and Redux -Netflix Clone

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

This project is a Netflix clone website built using React, Redux, and Firebase. It aims to replicate the main features and design of the popular streaming platform Netflix. The application fetches movie and TV show data from the TMDb (The Movie Database) API and provides a user-friendly interface for browsing and streaming content.

**Features**
User authentication: Users can create an account, log in, and log out using their email and password or third-party providers like Google or Facebook.
- Browse content: The website displays a wide range of movies and TV shows for streaming, allowing users to browse by genres or search for specific titles.
- Movie details: Users can click on a movie or TV show to view its details, including the synopsis, cast, and rating.
- My List: Registered users can add movies and TV shows to their personal list for easy access later.
- Responsive design: The application is designed to work seamlessly across different devices, such as desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
- Video streaming: Users can watch trailers and clips of movies or TV shows within the application.
- Continuous updates: The content is regularly updated by fetching the latest data from the TMDb API.

**Technologies Used**
React A JavaScript library used for building user interfaces.
Redux: A predictable state container for managing the application's state.
Firebase: A mobile and web development platform that provides authentication and hosting services.
TMDb API: An API that provides access to a comprehensive database of movies and TV shows.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have ever to use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
